Our plan of action is to research the slob.c first fit implementation, research the best fit algorithm, view the slob.c implementation in our kernel and find a template slob.c first fit algorithm that can be implemented into our kernel. We will edit the current implementation to include the best fit algorithm and record the necessary changes to that file and other files in a patch file.We will then look into how to generate a report of fragmentation by figuring out how to return the memory usage of our system under the first fit algorithm vs the best fit algorithm.
