TESTING

0. makefile for ebd.c is in the folder "moduleMakefile" if needed.

1. qemu command line modification to allow for module access by kernel "qemu-system-i386 -gdb tcp::5520 -S -nographic -kernel bzImage-qemux86.bin -drive file=core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext4 -enable-kvm -usb -localtime --no-reboot --append "root=/dev/hda rw console=ttyS0 debug" -redir tcp:6005::22"

2. in the module folder use this command to connect to kernel: scp -P 6005 ebd.ko root@localhost:/home/root

3. in the kernel command line: insmod ~/ebd.ko 

		this inserts the driver into the kernel space

4. in the kernel command line: mkfs.ext2 /dev/ebd0 (gives expected error)

5. in the kernel command line: mount -t ext2 /dev/ebd/ /mont/

6. simply echo a sample text into /mont/testfile, print statements within our ebd driver code will print statements that display the raw sample text before sending and the
	encrypted sample text after, you may also check the test file for encrypted data. When reading, the could will output the encrypted sample text and then 
	the decrypted sample text.
